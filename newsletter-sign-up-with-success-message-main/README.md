## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to do email input validation. was a little challenging cause the form kept submitting by itself at first even when I use preventDefault, so I used validation status the check if the input format is correct and then submit.

### Continued development

I think if I do another form validation project then I learn it completely.
